Forgive the spaghetti code, as majority was written in way too short of a
timeframe.

The syntax should be fairly straightforward, however it is not 100% tested.

No nested if/elif/else tags unless they exist within a .opt/.tpo declaration

The jump-point for new maps is "game/start.vad" - replace this to your heart's
content
